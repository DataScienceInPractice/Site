    "    - Or put another way: 'Python isn't the best at anything, but it's second best at everything'\n",

    "- Python is explicitly and by design, user-friendly.\n",
    "- Python also has a massive user community, who contribute to a large number of high-quality, well maintained open-source tools.\n",
    "    - The best language for your project is one which has the things you need.\n",
