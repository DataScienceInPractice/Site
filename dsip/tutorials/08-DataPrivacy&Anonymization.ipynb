Most notably, datasets are only provably anonymized under the assumption that no extra external information is available to be used to attempt to de-identify it. In practice, this means that de-anonymization of data can often be done by combining multiple datasets. By using information from multiple information sources, one can often use processes of elimination to decode the individuals included in a particular dataset."

    "### Unique Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Safe Harbor, and Data Anonymization in general, is to remove any unique information that could be used to identify you. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps most obvious for things like names. Other, perhaps less obvious specifications of Safe Harbour, are also based on the that this information being in a dataset creates a risk for identification of individuals contained in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, while it may be innocuous to talk about a 37 year old male who lives in Los Angeles (as there are many candidates, such that the specific individual is not revealed), it might actually be quite obvious who the person is when talking about a 37 year old male who lives in Potrero, California, a town of about 700 people. This is the same reason ages above 90 have to be removed - even in a fairly large area, say San Diego, it may be fairly obvious who the 98 year old female participant is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically - any information that makes you stand out is liable to identify you. Anonymization attempts to remove these kinds of indications from the data, such that individuals do not stand out in a way that lets someone figure out who they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also underlies the difficulty in protecting data in the face of multiple data sources, since collecting observations together makes it much easier to start to pick out people more uniquely. It may still be relatively easy to identify the 37 year old male from LA if you also happen to know (or figure out) that he has a poodle, is 5'6\", works at UCLA, and was at Griffith Park on Saturday, April 15th. All of this extra information may be relatively easy to figure out by combining publicly available, or easily obtainable, data."
