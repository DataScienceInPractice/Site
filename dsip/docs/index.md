# Data Science in Practice

Data Science in Practice is an open set of materials for learning and working on introductory data science.

This website is a public version of the Data Science in Practice course, taught under the course code 'COGS 108' at UC San Diego.

_If you are in the COGS108 class at UC San Diego, this website is **not** the same as course materials for the class._

### Overview

The goal and focus of Data Science in Practice is as an introductory course for learning Data Science, using the Python programming language. It is focused on the practical elements of doing data science - meaning on working with real data and problems.

You can read more about the course outline on the
[course syllabus](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview/blob/master/COGS108-Syllabus.pdf).

### Content

This set of online materials are an openly available version of the materials from the class version, that are available to anyone outside of the official course.

All the materials are available through the table of contents on the left.

Currently, available materials include:

- **Tutorials**, which are quick introductions to key topics for doing data science
- **Demo Assignments**, which are openly available versions of some of the course assignments that can be worked through to practice applying these ideas
